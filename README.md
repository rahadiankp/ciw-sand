Compile-it-Web (CIW) Sandbox
============================

Compile-it-Web Sandbox is similar to [ideone](http://ideone.com) but you can access it locally. Save your time by clicking the available and supported
programming languages, without switching to other IDEs! This project uses Ace to beautify the editor

More functions are to be implemented soon.

About Third-party
------------------

*Ace (Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor):

Ace is a standalone code editor written in JavaScript. Our goal is to create a browser based editor that matches and extends the features, usability and performance of existing native editors such as TextMate, Vim or Eclipse. It can be easily embedded in any web page or JavaScript application. Ace is developed as the primary editor for [Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io/) and the successor of the Mozilla Skywriter (Bespin) Project.

Contributing
------------

You can contribute to this project as well! Since bugs and no-neato codes are here and there, and I'm planning to implement more codes soon (themes, more languages, etc).
I would be very thankful to any small contributions to this project :D

Installing & Using
------------------

It's simple, just put/extract the CIW Sandbox to your _/var/www/_ folder, e.g. _/var/www/compiler_, and access it through _localhost/compiler_.

Warning

Since I have not implemented _system call warning_, please be aware that someone might use it for illegal stuff. Try to make it private and for your own use only.
